#summary american fuzzy lop: understanding status screen

When running `afl-fuzz`, the status screen looks roughly the following way:

{{{
afl-fuzz 0.20b
--------------

Queue cycle: 1

    Overall run time : 0 days, 0 hrs, 2 min, 34.00 sec
      Problems found : 2 crashes (1 unique), 67 hangs (13 unique)
       Last new path : 0 days, 0 hrs, 0 min, 36.58 sec ago
   Last unique crash : 0 days, 0 hrs, 2 min, 23.58 sec ago

In-depth stats:

     Execution paths : 1+0/99 done (1.01%)
       Current stage : interest 32/8, 30600/33490 done (91.37%)
    Execution cycles : 162476 (1055.02 per second)
      Bitmap density : 3542 tuples seen (10.81%)
  Fuzzing efficiency : path = 609.32, crash = 6.15, hang = 80.01 ppm

     Bit flip yields : 64/10272, 17/10270, 6/10266
    Byte flip yields : 1/1284, 4/1282, 2/1278
    Known int yields : 4/11556, 4/47510, 3/33390
  Havoc stage yields : 7/5000 (0 latent paths)
