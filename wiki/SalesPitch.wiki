In a hurry? There are several bite-sized reasons why you may want to give `afl-fuzz` a try:

  * <b>It is pretty sophisticated.</b> It's an instrumentation-guided genetic fuzzer capable of <a href='http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/11/pulling-jpegs-out-of-thin-air.html'>synthesizing complex file semantics</a> in a wide range of non-trivial targets.

  * <b>It has street smarts.</b> It is built around a range of <a href='http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/08/binary-fuzzing-strategies-what-works.html'>carefully researched</a>, high-gain test case preprocessing and fuzzing strategies rarely employed in this fashion in other fuzzing frameworks. Just as importantly, it is shown to <a href='https://code.google.com/p/american-fuzzy-lop/wiki/TrophyCase'>find real bugs</a>.

  * <b>It is fast.</b> Thanks to assembly-level instrumentation and <a href='http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/10/fuzzing-binaries-without-execve.html'>other optimizations</a>, the tool offers near-native fuzzing speeds against complex, real-world targets.

  * <b>It's rock solid.</b> Compared to other instrumentation- or solver-based fuzzers, American Fuzzy Lop has very few failure modes. It also comes with robust troubleshooting capabilities and user-friendly error messages.

  * <b>You don't need to tweak dozens of knobs.</b> In contrast to most other fuzzers, the tool requires essentially no effort to configure. Even if you wanted to, there are virtually no parameters to adjust.

  * <b>It's chainable.</b> The tool generates superior, compact <a href='http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl_demo/'>test corpuses</a> as a seed for more specialized processes and tools.
