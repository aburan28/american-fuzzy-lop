#summary Fuzzing "trophy case"

=american fuzzy lop: trophy case=

Although afl has quite a few external users, it is still under active development, and my own experiments are usually limited to recreational, single-machine, "vanilla" runs against some of the more difficult or better-fuzzed targets - say, IJG jpeg.

So far, this process has yielded in a couple of interesting finds that probably wouldn't be as easy to bump into or isolate with traditional tools:

  * <b><a href='http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Nov/83'>CVE-2013-6629</a></b>: JPEG SOS uninitialized memory disclosure in IJG jpeg.

  * <b><a href='http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Nov/83'>CVE-2013-6630</a></b>: JPEG DHT uninitialized memory disclosure in libjpeg-turbo.

  * <b><a href='http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/cve-2014-1564-uninitialized-memory-when.html'>CVE-2014-1564</a></b>: GIF-related disclosure of uninitialized memory in Firefox.

  * <b><a href='http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/10/two-more-browser-memory-disclosure-bugs.html'>CVE-2014-1580</a></b>: `<canvas>`-related use of uninitialized memory in Firefox.

  * <b><a href='http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/10/bash-bug-how-we-finally-cracked.html'>CVE-2014-6277</a></b>: memory corruption RCE in bash, working around the original "Shellshock" patch.

  * <b><a href='http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/10/bash-bug-how-we-finally-cracked.html'>CVE-2014-6278</a></b>: command injection RCE in bash, working around the original "Shellshock" patch.

  * <b><a href='https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1050342'>Mozilla bug #1050342</a></b>: Probably libjpeg-turbo related use of uninitialized memory in Chrome (pending with vendor).

  * <b><a href='https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=398235'>Chrome bug #398235</a></b>: Probably libjpeg-turbo related use of uninitialized memory in Chrome (pending with vendor).

  * <b><a href='http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/10/two-more-browser-memory-disclosure-bugs.html'>MSRC 0380191</a></b>: apparent JPEG DHT-related use of uninitialized memory in Internet Explorer.

  * <b><a href='https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17510'>Arbitrary memory access</a></b> bug in `/usr/bin/strings`.

  * Several pending issues in compression utilities.

As the codebase has gotten more mature over the past few months, I've been contemplating setting up afl for continuous fuzzing. So, more probably to come.
